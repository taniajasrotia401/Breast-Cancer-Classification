# ðŸ§  Breast Cancer Classification

A machine learning project to classify tumors as benign or malignant using various models.  
Techniques used: RFE for feature selection, SMOTE & ADASYN for class balancing, and GridSearchCV for tuning.

## âœ… Highlights
- Achieved **98% accuracy** and **AUC 0.999** using Random Forest + ADASYN.
- Compared models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, RF, XGBoost.
- Balanced data with SMOTE & ADASYN, improving minority class recall.

## ðŸ”„ Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned data, encoded features, and applied standard scaling.
2. **EDA**: Visualized feature importance, class distribution, and correlation.
3. **Feature Selection**: Used RFE to select top features for Logistic Regression.
4. **Modeling**: Trained models with and without resampling.
5. **Resampling**
